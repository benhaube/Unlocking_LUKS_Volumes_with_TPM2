# Unlocking LUKS Volumes with TPM2
This is a guide I have written up to setup LUKS volume decryption with the onboard TPM2 device. See [Unlock LUKS TPM2](Unlock_LUKS_TPM2.md) for instructions. 

**This repo has been depricated. Future updates to this guide will be made in the new repo I have created to house all of the GNU/Linux guides I have created and will create in the future. You can find this repo here: [Linux Configuration Tutorials](https://github.com/benhaube/Linux-Configuration-Tutorials/). Thank you!**
